## Required
* PHP >= v.8.0 
* Composer >= v.2.4
* We suggest you visit Laravel's official website

#### GD - PHP extension for photo manipulation
In this project are used packages for dynamically manipulating the attached photos, so it is possible that an error may appear if your "php.ini" file is not configured correctly. By default, this file disables certain extensions and these packages (dependencies) that we used in the project. All you need is:
<br>
->  Open your "php.ini" file as a text document (using Notepad or other similar software)
<br>
->  Find the line `;extension=gd` and change it to `extension=gd`
<br>
->  Restart your apache server
> If you don't know how to find the "php.ini" file... the most common path is `C:\php`. You can also type the command: `php --ini' in the command prompt to get more information

#### Possible error: 
-> "Unsupported cipher or incorrect key length. Supported ciphers are..."
<br>
It is a wrong generated APP_KEY ie. an application encryption key. Open the ".env" file located at the root of the project. Delete the entered value and run the command:
> php artisan key:generate

-> "SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it"
<br>
You may not have started your local server. Depending on which software you are using as a server package, start it as well as the Apache server and try again. Known softwares: WAMP, XAMPP, ampss, and so on.

## Installation
* Clone this repository using this command:
```shell
git clone https://github.com-tim4-22/library.git
 ```
* Enter the root folder if you are not already there

* Install/update composer packages:
```shell
composer install | composer update
```
* Copy .env.example file to the .env file and configure the variables according to your environment
* You can do this with the following command:
```shell
cp .env.example .env
```
* Since this application uses Algolia for searching, you will need to ask the administrator for the keys of the following variables:
```shell
SCOUT_DRIVER | SCOUT_QUEUE | ALGOLIA_APP_ID | ALGOLIA_SECRET
```
* Also, since this app uses Laravel Socialize for registration/log in using a third-party app/platform like Google, GitHub, etc. you will need to ask the administrator for the keys of the following variants:
```shell
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID | GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET | GITHUB_REDIRECT_URL
```
* Generate encryption key:
```shell
php artisan key:generate
``` 
* Run migrations:
```shell
php artisan migrate 
```
* If your database is already filled use this command:
```shell
php artisan migrate:fresh
```     
* For testing purposes, you can use Laravel's already built-in server with the command:
```shell
php artisan serve
```

After executing all the above commands, you should run the application and see it at http::/localhost of your domain depending on your configuration.

## Project organization
> All progress is tracked on the following project management platform:
- Trello
- monday.com
#### Both boards are synchronized.
> for links contact the administrator

## Credentials
* You can log in with the following credentials:
    * Email address: admin@gmail.com
    * Password: nekalozinka
    
* Project Workflow
    - When starting the application, you will be shown a "welcome" page with additional information
    - When you log in, you will be redirected to the "dashboard" page where you can see more things like the latest activities (same day), latest book bookings, book statistics, and so on
    - On this page you can go to other pages using the side menu (sidebar), enter your profile, log out, and more
    - Click on the image in the upper right corner to enter your profile or log out
    - Each user can delete his account, with a previously confirmed (dialog box) after which the application redirects him to a special "Goodbye" page
    
* There are three roles: 
- `administrator`, `librarian` and `student`

## Roles

### Administrator
* The administrator has access to everything on the application

### Librarian

## Returning the book
> Action - the book return operation is available only if the book has been issued

## Writing off the book
> Action - the book write-off operation is available only if the book is overdrawn

## Reservations - statuses
> Reservations have 5 statuses:
- Accepted
- Rejected
- On hold
- Archived
- Expired
## Sessions - flash messages - statuses
- Info
- Successfully
- Failed

## Protection and security
- Middleware protection on all routes (web and API)
- CSRF token - protection
- Used policies
- Password hashing - bcrypt
- Protection on three levels.. by roles -> administrator, librarian, and student

## Cron jobs - scheduled tasks
> There are 2 tasks:
- The first task that is executed on a daily basis and that automatically archives active expired reservations
- Another task that is executed on a monthly basis and automatically deletes users who have not logged in for more than 365 days.
## Shutdown mode
> The administrator can "send" the application to the so-called "shutdown" mode. Laravel has a built-in "php artisan down" command that "shuts down" the application.
Our application work using the web route "/shutdown" which is protected.

### Steps:
1. When you want to shut down the application -> Go to URL "{{base_url}}/shutdown" ! note: you must be logged in and be an "administrator"
2. When you want to start the application -> Go to the URL "{{base_url}}/live.php" after which a "redirect" page will appear
